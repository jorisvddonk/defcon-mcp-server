Here is the APIs you have access to:\n\nDebugLog(message)\nPrints message to the debug log.\n\nPlaceStructure(longitude, latitude, typename)\nTries to place a structure of type typename (see ยง2.3.1). Note that this can fail if structures are too close to each other.\n\nWhiteboardDraw(longitude1, latitude1, longitude2, latitude2)\nDraws a line segment on the whiteboard between (longitude1, latitude1) and (longitude2, latitude2).\n\nWhiteboardClear()\nClears all lines from the whiteboard.\n\nSendChat(message)\nSends a chat message to opponents; you can use this to intimidate them.\n\nAnd here are the enumerations:\n2.3 - Enumerations\nThe DEFCON AI API defines a number of enumerations (some of which are confusing refered to in the documentation as IDs, like territoryID). Most of these have become string constants, with the exception of unit stats, which are numeric constants.\n\n2.3.1 - Unit type\nThe following string constants are expected by all type name parameters, and are returned by all functions which return a type name:\n\n\"AirBase\"\n\"BattleShip\"\n\"Bomber\"\n\"Carrier\"\n\"City\"\n\"Explosion\"\n\"Fighter\"\n\"Fleet\"\n\"Gunshot\"\n\"Invalid\"\n\"Nuke\"\n\"RadarStation\"\n\"Saucer\"\n\"Silo\"\n\"Sub\"\n\"Tornado\"\n\"QueueItem\"\n"
